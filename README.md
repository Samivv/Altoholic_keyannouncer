A very simple plugin for the World of Warcraft addon Altoholic. 

It lets you share your m+ keys to your party (if in one) with a simple command(/aks) or via button added to Altoholic interface.

Need to have the original addon installed and DataStore atleast enabled for it to work.  

Hopefully someone else will find it useful aswell when wondering what to run with group next.
