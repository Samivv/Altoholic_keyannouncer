A very simple(unofficial) plugin for the World of Warcraft addon Altoholic. 

It lets you share all your alts' m+ keys to your party (if in one) with a simple command(/aks) or via button added to Altoholic interface.


Hopefully someone else will find it useful aswell when wondering what to run with group next.
